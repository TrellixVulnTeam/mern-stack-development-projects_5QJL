  // media query in short form using mixin, $variable, @if, @content, @mixin, @include
  // both for phone and tab-port, want 8px font size means 8px/16px*100=50%. So no need to define media query for root font size separately. Here 16px comes from browser default font size
  // phone: <=600px, tab-port: <=900px, tab-land: <=1200px, big-desktop: >=1800px
  // tab-port, tab-land both have max-width, tab-port is <=900px, tab-land is <=1200px, so tab-land must come before otherwise last one would apply and tab-port would never get to apply, tab-land -> tab-port
  // no problem with big-desktop order as it has min-width, so only will apply above 1800px
